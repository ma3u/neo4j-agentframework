## ✅ Completed Steps

1. ✅ Git repository initialized
2. ✅ All files staged
3. ✅ Initial commit created with comprehensive message
4. ✅ Project structure ready for GitHub

## 📋 To Publish Your Repository

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository:
- **Repository name**: `neo4j-rag-system` (or your preferred name)
- **Description**: "A powerful RAG system built on Neo4j with vector search and hybrid retrieval"
- **Visibility**: Public (recommended for open source)
- **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)

### 2. Connect and Push to GitHub

Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/neo4j-rag-system.git

# Or if using SSH (recommended)
git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/neo4j-rag-system.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Configure Repository Settings

After pushing, go to your GitHub repository settings and:

#### Add Topics (for better discoverability):
- `neo4j`
- `rag`
- `vector-search`
- `graph-database`
- `python`
- `retrieval-augmented-generation`
- `llm`
- `embeddings`
- `knowledge-graph`

#### Create Your First Release:
```bash
# Tag your release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release - Neo4j RAG System"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### 4. Quick Verification

After pushing, verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check remote status
git remote -v
