# Neo4j GraphRAG for Hybrid Environments (Azure Cloud + Local/On-Prem)

## üéØ Question

Is **Neo4j GraphRAG Python package** suitable for **hybrid deployments** that combine:
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Azure Cloud** (production workloads)
- üè¢ **Local/On-Premises** (development, sensitive data, sovereignty requirements)

## üìã Context

Our project ([neo4j-agentframework](https://github.com/ma3u/neo4j-agentframework)) currently implements a **flexible hybrid architecture**:

### Current Setup
- **Production**: Neo4j Aura (Azure westeurope) + Azure AI Foundry + Container Apps
- **Development**: Docker Compose (local Neo4j + BitNet LLM + RAG service)
- **Knowledge Base**: 12 technical books, 30,006 chunks, 100% embedded

### Key Requirements
1. **Same codebase** works in both environments (cloud/local)
2. **Data sovereignty** for sensitive documents (local processing)
3. **Cost optimization** (local development, cloud production)
4. **Zero external dependencies** option (fully local stack available)

## ü§î Specific Questions

### 1. Database Flexibility
Can GraphRAG work seamlessly with:
- ‚úÖ Neo4j Aura (managed cloud) for production
- ‚úÖ Neo4j Docker (local) for development
- ‚úÖ Neo4j Enterprise (on-prem) for sensitive data

**Use Case**: Developer tests locally with Docker, deploys same code to Azure Aura production.

### 2. LLM Flexibility
Does GraphRAG support **multiple LLM backends** for hybrid scenarios:
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini) for production
- üè† BitNet.cpp (1.58-bit quantized) for local sovereign environments
- ü§ñ Ollama/LM Studio for on-premises deployments

**Current Challenge**: We use Azure AI Foundry in cloud, BitNet locally. Can GraphRAG adapt?

### 3. Embedding Model Portability
We currently use **SentenceTransformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)** locally to avoid API costs:
- 384-dimensional embeddings
- Runs on CPU (no GPU required)
- Same model in both environments

**Question**: Can GraphRAG `VectorCypherRetriever` work with:
- Local SentenceTransformers embeddings (development)
- Azure OpenAI embeddings (production, if needed)
- Mixed environments (some documents embedded locally, others in cloud)

### 4. Entity Extraction Cost Control
Our concern about cloud costs:
- **Local entity extraction**: Process sensitive PDFs on-premises, push only graph structure to cloud
- **Cloud entity extraction**: Use Azure OpenAI for public documents
- **Hybrid approach**: Extract entities locally during development, re-use in cloud

**Question**: Can we run entity extraction **locally** and sync the resulting knowledge graph to cloud Neo4j?

### 5. Network & Connectivity
For air-gapped or restricted environments:
- Can GraphRAG work **fully offline** (local Neo4j + local LLM)?
- What are the **minimum external dependencies** if any?
- Does it require internet for any core functionality?

**Critical for**: Government, healthcare, financial services with data residency requirements.

## üí° Proposed Hybrid Architecture

```python
# Configuration that adapts to environment
import os
from neo4j_graphrag.llm import AzureOpenAILLM, OpenAILLM
from neo4j_graphrag.retrievers import VectorCypherRetriever

# Environment-aware setup
if os.getenv("DEPLOYMENT_ENV") == "production":
    # Azure Cloud Production
    neo4j_uri = "neo4j+s://6b870b04.databases.neo4j.io"
    llm = AzureOpenAILLM(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT")
    )
else:
    # Local Development / On-Prem
    neo4j_uri = "bolt://localhost:7687"
    llm = LocalLLM(  # BitNet, Ollama, etc.
        endpoint="http://localhost:8001"
    )

# Same GraphRAG code works everywhere
retriever = VectorCypherRetriever(
    driver=driver,
    index_name="text_embeddings",
    embedder=local_embedder,  # SentenceTransformers
    retrieval_query=custom_query
)
```

## üìä Why This Matters

### Cost Savings
- **Development**: Free local processing (no API costs during iteration)
- **Production**: Pay only for actual production queries
- **Current**: $355-755/month vs $1,000-2,500+ traditional cloud-only

### Compliance & Sovereignty
- **Healthcare**: Process PHI locally, sync anonymized graph to cloud
- **Financial**: Keep sensitive data on-premises, use cloud for public knowledge
- **Government**: Fully air-gapped option for classified environments

### Developer Experience
- **Fast iteration**: No cloud delays during development
- **Same code**: Works in laptop Docker ‚Üí Azure Container Apps
- **No surprises**: Testing locally = production behavior
