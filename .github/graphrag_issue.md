# Evaluate and Integrate Neo4j GraphRAG for Enhanced Knowledge Graph Capabilities

## 🎯 Objective

Evaluate and potentially integrate **Neo4j GraphRAG Python package (v1.10.0)** to enhance our production RAG system with graph intelligence, entity extraction, and multi-hop reasoning capabilities while maintaining our 417x performance optimization.

## 📋 Context

**Current System** (Production):
- ✅ 30,006 chunks across 12 technical books
- ✅ 417x optimized vector search (110ms queries)
- ✅ Hybrid deployment (local Docker + Neo4j Aura)
- ✅ Azure AI Foundry integration
- ❌ No entity extraction or graph traversal
- ❌ Limited cross-document reasoning

**Neo4j GraphRAG** (Official Package):
- ✅ VectorCypherRetriever (vector + graph traversal)
- ✅ SimpleKGPipeline (entity extraction)
- ✅ Multi-LLM support (Azure OpenAI, Ollama, custom)
- ✅ Hybrid environment compatible
- ❓ Performance impact unknown

## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Evaluation & Testing (Week 1) - Priority: HIGH

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Install `neo4j-graphrag[openai,sentence-transformers]==1.10.0`
- [ ] Test compatibility with existing Aura instance (`6b870b04`)
- [ ] Create `Neo4jGraphRAGRetriever` wrapper class
- [ ] Run side-by-side comparison: current vs GraphRAG (10 test queries)
- [ ] Measure latency impact (target: <200ms acceptable)
- [ ] Validate hybrid deployment (local + cloud)

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] `neo4j-rag-demo/src/neo4j_graphrag_retriever.py` (wrapper)
- [ ] `neo4j-rag-demo/tests/test_graphrag_performance.py` (benchmarks)
- [ ] Performance report document

**Success Criteria**:
- GraphRAG works with our existing data (no schema changes needed)
- Latency overhead <90ms (total <200ms)
- Works in both local Docker and Aura environments

---

### Phase 2: Entity Extraction PoC (Week 2) - Priority: MEDIUM

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Select 1-2 representative books (~2,500 chunks)
- [ ] Configure SimpleKGPipeline with Azure OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini)
- [ ] Extract entities: Technology, Concept, Framework, Author
- [ ] Manual quality assessment (review 50 random entities)
- [ ] Measure cost (actual vs estimated $2-3)
- [ ] Test VectorCypherRetriever with entity graph

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] `neo4j-rag-demo/scripts/extract_entities_graphrag.py`
- [ ] Entity extraction quality report
- [ ] Cost analysis

**Success Criteria**:
- Entity extraction accuracy >80%
- Entities provide useful relationships
- Cost within budget (<$5 for PoC)

---

### Phase 3: Integration & A/B Testing (Week 3) - Priority: MEDIUM

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Integrate GraphRAG retriever into main system
- [ ] Add API flag: `?use_graphrag=true`
- [ ] Create 20 test queries (simple + complex)
- [ ] A/B test: current vs GraphRAG on quality + latency
- [ ] Document trade-offs (performance vs context richness)

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Updated `neo4j-rag-demo/src/neo4j_rag.py` (hybrid support)
- [ ] A/B test results document
- [ ] Decision recommendation

**Success Criteria**:
- GraphRAG improves answer quality by ≥20%
- Performance acceptable for production use
- Clear recommendation: proceed or defer

---

### Phase 4: Production Rollout (Optional, Week 4+) - Priority: LOW

**Tasks** (if Phase 3 is successful):
- [ ] Extract entities for all 30K chunks (~$5-10)
- [ ] Update Azure AI Foundry Assistant functions
- [ ] Deploy to Azure Container Apps
- [ ] Update documentation (README, Cypher queries)
- [ ] Add monitoring for GraphRAG queries
- [ ] Update NODES2025 presentation materials

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Full entity graph in Aura instance
- [ ] Updated deployment documentation
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero production issues
- User feedback positive
- Latency within SLA

## 📊 Comparison: Current vs GraphRAG

| Feature | Current System | With GraphRAG |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Vector search | ✅ 110ms | ✅ 150-200ms (est.) |
| Entity extraction | ❌ None | ✅ Automated |
| Graph traversal | ❌ None | ✅ Multi-hop |
| Cross-document links | ❌ Limited | ✅ Rich |
| Maintenance | ⚠️ Custom | ✅ Neo4j supported |
| Performance | ✅ Optimized | ❓ To be tested |

See detailed comparison: `docs/GRAPHRAG_COMPARISON.md`

## 💰 Cost Analysis

**One-Time Costs**:
- Entity extraction (30K chunks): ~$5-10 (gpt-4o-mini)
- Development time: 2-3 weeks
- Testing & validation: 1 week

**Ongoing Costs**:
- $0 additional (uses existing infrastructure)
- Entity graph stored in same Aura instance (+10% storage)

**Alternative** (Free):
- Use Ollama/BitNet for local entity extraction (slower but $0)
