## Component Details

### 1. Azure AI Foundry Project
**Purpose**: Central hub for AI model management and agent orchestration
**Configuration**:
- Model deployment: GPT-4o-mini (or GPT-4o for production)
- Agent service enabled
- Monitoring and logging configured
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### 2. Neo4j RAG Agent (Container Apps)
**Purpose**: Containerized application hosting the optimized Neo4j RAG system
**Key Features**:
- Microsoft Agent Framework integration
- 417x performance optimizations preserved
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- Health checks and monitoring

### 3. Neo4j Database (Container Apps)
**Purpose**: High-performance graph database with vector search capabilities
**Configuration**:
- Production memory settings (4GB heap, 2GB page cache)
- Persistent storage with backup to Azure Storage
- Full-text indexes and vector indexes
- Connection pooling optimized

### 4. Authentication & Security
**Method**: Azure CLI Credential / Managed Identity
**Components**:
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- Azure RBAC for service-to-service authentication
- Environment-based configuration

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. Create Azure AI Foundry project
2. Deploy AI models (GPT-4o-mini)
3. Set up Container Apps environment
4. Configure networking and security

### Phase 2: Core Services
1. Deploy Neo4j container with production configuration
2. Deploy Neo4j RAG Agent with Agent Framework integration
3. Configure service discovery and communication
4. Set up monitoring and logging

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing
1. Connect to Azure AI services
2. Implement health checks and monitoring
3. Performance testing and optimization
4. Security validation

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
1. Set up CI/CD pipelines
2. Configure auto-scaling
3. Implement backup and disaster recovery
4. Documentation and training

## Performance Considerations

### Preserving 417x Performance Gains
- **Connection Pooling**: Maintain optimized Neo4j connection pool
- **Query Caching**: Preserve intelligent caching system
- **Parallel Processing**: Keep vector + keyword search parallelization
- **Container Resources**: Allocate sufficient CPU/memory for performance

### Azure-Specific Optimizations
- **Container Apps**: Use consumption-based scaling for cost optimization
- **Regional Deployment**: Deploy in same region as AI models for low latency
- **Network Optimization**: Use private networking for database connections

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Sizing
- **Agent Container**: 2 CPU, 4GB RAM (scales 0-10 instances)
- **Neo4j Container**: 4 CPU, 8GB RAM (persistent, always-on)
- **AI Model**: GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective performance

### Scaling Strategy
- **Agent App**: Auto-scale based on HTTP requests
- **Database**: Fixed size with connection pooling
- **Storage**: Premium SSD for Neo4j data, Standard for backups

## Security Architecture

### Identity & Access
- **Managed Identity**: For Azure service authentication
- **RBAC**: Least privilege access model
- **Network Security**: Private endpoints and VNets

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: At rest and in transit
- **Key Management**: Azure Key Vault integration
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity monitoring

## Monitoring & Observability

### Application Insights Integration
- **Agent Framework Telemetry**: Built-in OpenTelemetry support
- **Custom Metrics**: Neo4j performance metrics
- **Query Analytics**: RAG query performance and accuracy
- **Health Monitoring**: Service availability and dependencies

### Alerting Strategy
- **Performance Degradation**: Response time > 1 second
- **Error Rates**: > 5% error rate
- **Resource Utilization**: > 80% CPU/Memory
- **Database Connectivity**: Connection failures

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- **Neo4j Data**: Daily backups to Azure Storage
- **Configuration**: Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/ARM)
- **Application Code**: Git-based versioning

### Recovery Procedures
- **RTO**: < 1 hour for service restoration
- **RPO**: < 24 hours for data loss
- **Automated Recovery**: Container Apps auto-restart
- **Manual Procedures**: Database restore from backup

This architecture ensures that your high-performance Neo4j RAG system is preserved while gaining the benefits of Azure's enterprise-grade infrastructure and Microsoft Agent Framework integration.
